# Weather Report
Full stack (React, NodeJs, MongoDB) weather reporting application that stores user's keywords and weather to a database.

If launched locally backend (NodeJS) has to manually set to use port 8081, since frontend(React) uses proxy for localhost:8081 to reach all of the API's from it.
MongoDB local server should be okay regardless what port chooses.
